## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 3-panel swipeable overlay appears after first agent creation
- [ ] Overlay is non-blocking and dismissible (tap outside or swipe)
- [ ] Panel 1 introduces Command Bar feature
- [ ] Panel 2 introduces Agents feature
- [ ] Panel 3 introduces Workflows feature
- [ ] Each panel has illustration, title, and description
- [ ] Progress indicator (dots) shows current panel
- [ ] "Skip" option available on each panel
- [ ] All entities generated using ZFA (Zorphy) with JSON serialization

## Task
Implement the quick tour overlay that introduces key app features to new users.

### Overlay Design:
- Semi-transparent dark background (blocks interaction with underlying UI)
- Centered card with rounded corners
- Swipeable horizontally (left/right gestures)
- Page indicator dots at bottom
- "Skip" button at top-right
- "Next" / "Get Started" button at bottom

### Panel 1: Command Bar
**Title:** "Command Bar"
**Illustration:** Animated graphic showing:
- Pull-down gesture on mobile
- Or keyboard shortcut `Cmd+K` on desktop
**Description:** "This is your **Command Bar** — talk to any agent from anywhere in the app. Just swipe down or press `Cmd+K` to instantly access your agents."

### Panel 2: Agents
**Title:** "Your Agents"
**Illustration:** Animated graphic showing:
- Agent cards in a grid
- Tap and long-press gestures
- Drag to rearrange
**Description:** "Your **Agents** live here — tap to chat, long-press to configure or arrange. Each agent is customized for specific tasks."

### Panel 3: Workflows
**Title:** "Workflows"
**Illustration:** Animated graphic showing:
- Visual workflow canvas
- Nodes connected with lines
- Data flowing through the workflow
**Description:** "**Workflows** chain agents together — build once, run anytime. Automate complex tasks by connecting multiple agents."

### Interaction Details:
- Swipe left to go to next panel
- Swipe right to go to previous panel
- Tap "Next" button to advance
- On last panel, "Next" becomes "Get Started"
- Tap "Skip" or outside the card to dismiss
- Dismissing marks tour as completed

### State Management:
- Track `hasCompletedTour` boolean
- If completed, don't show tour again
- Option to re-play tour from Settings

### Animations:
- Smooth slide transition between panels (300ms)
- Fade-in for text and illustrations
- Subtle bounce on page indicator dots
- Card entrance animation (scale from 0.8 to 1.0 with fade)

### Responsive Behavior:
- On mobile: Full-width card with padding
- On tablet/desktop: Centered card with max-width (400-500px)
- On desktop: Also show keyboard shortcuts in descriptions

### Edge Cases:
- If user skips during tour, still mark as offered
- If app is in explore mode, mention features are view-only
- Persist tour state even if app is closed mid-tour

## ZFA Architecture Requirements

### Entity Definition

**TourState Entity:**
```bash
zfa entity create -n TourState --field "id:String,hasCompletedTour:bool,currentPanel:int,hasSeenCommandBar:bool,hasSeenAgents:bool,hasSeenWorkflows:bool,completedAt:DateTime?" --json
```

### Clean Architecture Generation

Generate for TourState (singleton):
```bash
zfa generate TourState --methods=get,update --data --vpc --state
```

### Implementation Notes

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Use single instance for tour state
2. **Persistence**: Store in local preferences/storage
3. **Replay Option**: Add reset method to allow re-playing tour from settings
